# blueprints

These blueprints are offered as learning examples only with no warranty, support or guarantee that they will work in your environment. They are currently only curated by myself and tested with the latest version of Calm/PC/AOS.

DCOS - Prepares and configures a Mesosphere environment with a single master, single worker, and bootstrap node.

Rebootpersist - Instead of rebooting a node for configuration changes, Calm supports starting and stopping the node.

Testwin - Simple windows 2016 example VM deployment.
